## What is this repo?
This is going to be a school project based on some code we got from our teacher and some requirements. I am going to add the requirements to this README later.

## What is this code?
It's a game. You play a character in a post apokoliptik setting where you need to do some quests and fight some monsters. You mainly control by giving number input and pressing enter. 

In fights, you need to input rows and columns to move. A row is **NOT** a coordinate along the X axis but rather what row you want to use(so basically the Y axis) same with columns.
