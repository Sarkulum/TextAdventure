## What is this repo?
This is going to be a school project based on some code we got from our teacher and some requirements.

## What is this code?
It's a text based game. You play a character in a post apokoliptik setting where you need to do some quests and fight some zombies. You mainly control by giving number input and pressing enter. 

## Controls
In fights, you need to input rows and columns to move. A row is **NOT** a coordinate along the X axis but rather what row you want to use(so basically the Y axis) same with columns.


## How to finish the game.
